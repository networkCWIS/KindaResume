# KindaResume
This resume website was terrible when I first made it years ago. 
I tried to build a page from scratch, and was able to get it working to some extent, but given that I was a junior in high school, did not take it seriously, or ever host it.
I am using a template from the folks over at https://html5up.net/ - specifically their forty template.
This website will likely take some time to be customized fully, as well as hosted - thankfully I have the compute to do this now.
